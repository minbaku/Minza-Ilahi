🔬 **Bioinformatics Enthusiast**  
Currently working on
*[Decoding Pathogen–Host Molecular Mimicry Through Integrative Immunoinformatics and Structural Systems Biology for Predictive Autoimmunity Risk Assessment](project-link)*:  
*This project seeks to systematically decode pathogen–host molecular mimicry — a phenomenon where pathogen proteins resemble human proteins, enabling immune evasion and triggering autoimmune disease. While previous studies have identified isolated cases (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni in Guillain-Barré syndrome), no integrative framework exists to comprehensively predict and rank mimicry events across pathogens.

The research will develop a multi-layered computational pipeline combining sequence homology, epitope mapping, and structural bioinformatics with immune pathway analysis and AI-driven prioritization. High-confidence mimicry candidates will then be experimentally validated in collaboration with immunology laboratories.

Expected outcomes include an open-access web platform, a ranked atlas of mimicry hotspots across bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens, and a predictive machine learning model with high accuracy. This work will provide the first end-to-end system for mimicry prediction, with direct applications in vaccine safety design, therapeutic target discovery, and autoimmune risk assessment.*
